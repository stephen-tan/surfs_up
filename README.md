# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to gather observed temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. To complete the analysis, Python was used with libraries such as Pandas, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy<br/>

## Results
The results below show summary statistics for observed temperatures for both June and December. </br>

- Temperature averages were 74.9&deg;F for June and 71.0&deg;F for December; June is on average, 3.9 &deg;F warmer than December. </br>
- June gets as cold as 64&deg;F and as hot as 85&deg;F. </br>
- December gets as cold as 56&deg;F and as hot as 83&deg;F. There is a larger temperature range in December, which can be seen from the larger standard deviation (3.75 in December vs 3.26 in June) </br>

## Summary
The surf and ice cream shop business will still be able to thrive throughout the year. Though queries were only made for June and December, we were able to see that the minimum temperatures for those months were 64&deg;F and 56&deg;F, respectively. 56&deg;F may seem like a cooler temperature for December, but with temperatures still reaching 83&deg;F, folks could still enjoy surfing and eating ice cream. To get a better sense of what temperatures would be like all year round, two more queries for March and September can be made to gather quarterly temperature data. </br>
